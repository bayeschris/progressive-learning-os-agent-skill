# Dual-Track Cadence (Execution Speed + Learning Depth)

Run two tracks in parallel every cycle.

## Track A — Objective Throughput (non-negotiable)
- Ship decision-relevant outputs on schedule.
- If learning is incomplete, proceed with best-supported interim assumptions.
- Mark assumptions with expiry dates and verification tasks.

## Track B — Compounding Learning (aggressive)
- Run targeted deep dives that can exceed immediate delivery scope.
- Convert deep-dive insights into upgrades of risk model, assays, or decision thresholds.

## 60/30/10 allocation
- 60%: objective-critical execution
- 30%: near-term learning that unlocks next gate
- 10%: frontier drill-ins (not yet required but strategically valuable)

## Constraint
- Never block Track A waiting for Track B.
- Instead: ship with explicit uncertainty + next falsification test.
