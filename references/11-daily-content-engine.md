# Daily Content Engine (Objective → Status → Focus → Learnings)

Use this every day to turn real project progress into high-value teaching content.

## Daily spine (required)
Every day, publish from this structure:
1. **Objective (reiterated):** what the project is trying to achieve.
2. **Project status:** where things stand right now (truthful, concrete).
3. **Daily focus:** what is being pushed today and why it matters.
4. **Learning of the day:** one insight worth teaching.
5. **Audience value lens:**
   - novice value: what this teaches from first principles
   - expert value: what reframes or sharpens known concepts

## Source-of-truth rule
Build content only from same-day artifacts:
- decision packet delta
- risk ranking updates
- learn cards
- execution board movement
- drill-in outputs

Never fabricate progress for narrative smoothness.

## 5-minute daily kickoff inputs (before drafting)
- Objective sentence for today
- Current status in one line (where the project actually is)
- Today's focus move (one highest-leverage push)
- Learning candidate (what was new or reframed)
- One concrete audience takeaway (actionable)

## Message quality standard
Each daily piece must include at least one of:
- a concrete framework
- a practical checklist
- a decision heuristic
- a surprising evidence-backed insight

## Daily publish bundle
Create 4 derivatives from the same spine:

### 1) LinkedIn (primary, 180–350 words)
- Hook tied to today's objective tension
- Status snapshot (1 short paragraph)
- Daily focus (what was prioritized)
- Learning of the day (teaching moment)
- Expert reframe (what changed in your model)
- Closing question to invite discussion

### 2) X/Twitter (byte-sized)
Option A: one post (high-signal)
- Objective + today's shift + one teaching line

Option B: 3-post thread
1. Objective + current bottleneck
2. What we tested/changed today
3. Learning + how others can apply it

### 3) TikTok short script (30–60s)
- 0–5s: objective hook
- 5–15s: where project is now
- 15–35s: today's focus move
- 35–50s: learning explained simply
- 50–60s: expert-level reframe + CTA

### 4) arXiv pathway note (internal but publish-oriented)
Append to running paper notes:
- Today's objective context
- Method/decision change
- Evidence or rationale update
- New limitation discovered
- Open question for next cycle

## Two-layer teaching pattern (required)
For the "learning of the day", always provide:
- **Layer 1 (plain):** simple explanation for non-experts
- **Layer 2 (expert):** technical nuance, caveat, or model refinement

## Daily closeout checklist
- Objective stated clearly
- Status is specific and evidence-linked
- Focus explains prioritization logic
- Learning includes novice + expert layers
- At least one actionable takeaway for audience
- 3 skill upgrades shipped and logged (what changed + why)
- Skill upgrades scored with `references/13-skill-upgrade-scoring-rubric.md` (avg >=12; at least one >=15)
- No confidential or unverified claims

## Reusable prompt for generating daily drafts
"Using today’s project artifacts, draft LinkedIn + X + TikTok + arXiv-note updates using this structure: Objective, Status, Daily Focus, Learning of the Day (plain + expert), Audience Takeaway. Keep claims evidence-linked and specific."
