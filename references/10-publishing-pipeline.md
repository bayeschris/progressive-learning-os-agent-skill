# Publishing Pipeline (LinkedIn + X/Twitter + TikTok + arXiv)

## A) LinkedIn (primary narrative)
Template:
- Hook: what changed in how you work with AI
- Insight: what AI did as collaborator/teacher/researcher
- Evidence: one concrete example from this week
- Reflection: what surprised you
- Invite: one question to peers

Length: 150–350 words.
Frequency: 1–3 posts/week.

## B) X/Twitter (byte-sized)
Template options:
1. Single post: one sharp insight + one example + one takeaway.
2. 3-post mini-thread:
   - Post 1: problem
   - Post 2: method with AI
   - Post 3: result and lesson

Length: concise, high-signal.
Frequency: daily or near-daily.

## C) TikTok (short educational clip)
30–60 sec script:
- 0–5s: hook (“I used AI in 3 roles today…”) 
- 5–25s: one concrete workflow moment
- 25–45s: before/after impact
- 45–60s: takeaway + CTA

Frequency: 2–5 clips/week.

## D) arXiv pathway (research-grade output)
Pipeline:
1. Keep a running `paper-notes.md` with claim-evidence pairs.
2. Maintain `related-work.md` and `methods.md` in parallel.
3. At milestone, draft structured preprint skeleton:
   - Abstract
   - Introduction
   - Methods
   - Results
   - Limitations
   - References
4. Run internal evidence audit before preprint posting.

## Publish readiness checklist
- Claim/evidence aligned
- No confidential leakage
- Uncertainty explicitly labeled
- Reproducibility notes included where relevant
