# Hardcore Drill-In Protocol

Use when you need depth beyond current learning speed without stalling execution.

## Choose drill-in targets
Pick 1–2 high-leverage questions:
- Could invalidate current strategy
- Could unlock a major efficiency/safety gain
- Could re-rank top risks

## Produce a Drill-In Brief (1 page)
- Question:
- Why this matters now:
- Current default assumption:
- Competing hypotheses (H1/H2/H3):
- Evidence map (PMID/DOI/URL):
- Fast falsification experiment/analysis:
- Decision impact if true vs false:

## Output requirements
- End with: "What changes Monday morning?"
- Add one concrete update to either:
  - risk ranking,
  - decision gate thresholds, or
  - day 0–7 task board.

## Timebox
- Standard: 45–90 minutes per drill-in
- Emergency: 20-minute rapid drill-in
- Maximum parallel drill-ins: 2
