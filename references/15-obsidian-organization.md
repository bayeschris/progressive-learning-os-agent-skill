# Obsidian Organization Standard

Store all run outputs under:
`obsidian/Progressive-Learning-OS/`

## Folder map
- `00-Index/` — navigation notes and current cycle links
- `01-Objective/` — objective + gates snapshots
- `02-Risks/` — ranked risk maps
- `03-Learn-Cards/` — topic learn cards
- `04-Research/` — evidence maps, decision packets, drill-ins
- `05-Execution/` — day 0–7 boards, checkpoints
- `06-Publishing/` — LinkedIn/X/TikTok drafts + arXiv pathway notes
- `07-Skill-Evolution/` — skill upgrade logs + rubric scores
- `08-Research-Improvement/` — daily KPI logs and post-mortems

## Naming rules
- Use date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Versioned docs: append `-v0.x` (e.g., `2026-02-22-decision-packet-v0.3.md`)
- Keep one canonical latest link in `00-Index/current-cycle.md`

## Daily filing checklist
1. Save today’s Objective/Status/Focus note.
2. File any new learn cards under `03-Learn-Cards/`.
3. File decision/research deltas under `04-Research/`.
4. File publish drafts under `06-Publishing/`.
5. Update index links in `00-Index/current-cycle.md`.

## Cross-link rule
Every note should include:
- `Objective:` link
- `Current decision packet:` link
- `Today’s execution board:` link
