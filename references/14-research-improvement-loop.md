# Daily Research Improvement Loop

Run this at the end of every research day.

## 1) Score today’s research quality (required)
Track these KPIs daily:
- **Time-to-decision:** time from question to decision-ready recommendation
- **Evidence strength ratio:** % key claims backed by high-quality sources
- **Rework count:** number of major revisions due to weak reasoning/evidence gaps
- **False-lead rate:** % effort spent on paths later discarded
- **Decision reversal count:** decisions reversed due to missed/weak evidence

## 2) Run a 10-minute research post-mortem
- What was slow?
- What was wrong or noisy?
- What was surprisingly effective?
- What should be stopped immediately?

## 3) Convert findings into upgrades (required)
Ship 1–3 concrete research upgrades daily:
- template improvement
- checklist/rubric improvement
- evidence workflow rule
- script/tooling improvement

Each upgrade must include:
- trigger (when to use)
- expected KPI impact
- validation plan (how to verify it helped)

## 4) Trial vs Standard rule
- New methods start as **Trial**.
- Promote to **Standard** only after success in 2+ real cycles.
- Archive methods that fail to improve KPIs.

## 5) Daily output (required)
Produce a one-screen log:
1. KPI snapshot (today vs yesterday)
2. Top failure mode observed
3. Upgrades shipped today
4. What changes tomorrow’s research flow

## Escalation rule
If 2+ KPIs degrade for 2 consecutive days, pause new exploration and run a process-correction day focused on method quality.
