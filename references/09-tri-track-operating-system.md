# Tri-Track Operating System

Run these tracks in parallel every cycle.

## Track 1 — Learning (internal capability growth)
Goal: increase your understanding faster than passive exposure.

Outputs:
- Learn Cards
- Teach-back notes
- Weekly learning review

Cadence:
- Daily: 1 focused learning block
- Weekly: 1 synthesis review

## Track 2 — Researching (decision-quality engine)
Goal: produce evidence-backed decisions and execution artifacts.

Outputs:
- Risk breakdown
- Evidence map
- Decision packet versions
- Day 0–7 execution board

Cadence:
- Daily: objective-critical progress
- Per gate: Go/Hold/Kill update

## Track 3 — Publishing (public narrative + compounding credibility)
Goal: externalize insights in multi-format content while work is in motion.

Outputs:
- LinkedIn narrative post (collaborator + teacher + researcher framing)
- Byte-sized X/Twitter thread or post
- Short TikTok script outline
- Paper pathway artifact (arXiv-ready note stream)

Cadence:
- Daily: one micro publish asset
- Weekly: one long-form LinkedIn post
- Monthly: one research-note-to-preprint milestone

## Integration rule
Every major research milestone should generate:
1) one learning update,
2) one decision/execution update,
3) one publishable public artifact.

## Guardrails
- Do not publish confidential or unverified claims.
- Label uncertainty clearly.
- Separate hypothesis from evidence.
- Treat social content as derivative of research artifacts, not the source of truth.
